# Phase 1 — Project Cleanup & Internationalization for Community Water Level IoT

**Date**: 2025-09-12
**Status**: 🔄 **ONGOING - SYSTEMATIC REVIEW PHASE**

## Objective

This phase aims to streamline the codebase by removing unnecessary features and implementing comprehensive internationalization (i18n) support. Additionally, we are conducting a systematic review of all existing screens to identify and fix issues before proceeding to Phase 2 IoT features.

## Scope (This Phase)

### 🗂️ Part 1: Remove Unnecessary Features ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ Remove `codegen` functionality (views, API, enums, mock)
- ✅ Remove all demo pages and related files from `src/views/demo`
- ✅ Clean up menu items in `mock/menu.mock.ts` that point to deleted components
- ✅ Check and simplify route generation logic to avoid referencing deleted demo components
- ✅ Verify that the development server can start and perform basic validation

### 🌍 Part 2: Internationalization Implementation & Review ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ Set English as default language for new users (international competition requirement)
- ✅ Review and fix hardcoded strings in existing components
- ✅ Implement comprehensive i18n for Profile page
- ✅ Expand language packages with missing translations
- ✅ Ensure all user-facing text supports language switching

### 🔍 Part 3: Systematic Screen Review & Bug Fixes 🔄 IN PROGRESS

- ✅ Profile page complete review and fixes
- ✅ Department field terminology updated for community context
- ✅ Router i18n implementation and comment translation
- ✅ Logout dialog internationalization fix
- ✅ User management page simplified for community focus
- 🔄 Systematic review of all existing screens for:
  - UI/UX issues
  - Form validation problems
  - Internationalization gaps
  - Component state management issues
  - Performance optimization opportunities
- 📋 Each screen will be individually tested and fixed before Phase 2

## Next Steps (Systematic Review & Phase 2 Planning)

### 🔍 Current Approach: Systematic Screen Review

As part of the quality assurance process, each existing screen will be individually reviewed and fixed:

1. **Screen-by-Screen Analysis**:
   - UI/UX consistency check
   - Form validation testing
   - Internationalization compliance
   - Component state management verification
   - Performance evaluation

2. **Issue Identification & Resolution**:
   - Document any found issues
   - Implement fixes following Vue 3 best practices
   - Test changes thoroughly
   - Update documentation

3. **Quality Gates**:
   - Each screen must pass review before Phase 2
   - All critical bugs must be resolved
   - Internationalization must be complete
   - Code quality standards must be met

### 📋 Phase 2 Preparation

Once all existing screens pass systematic review:

1. **Final Validation**:

   ```powershell
   pnpm build
   pnpm lint
   pnpm type-check
   ```

2. **IoT Feature Development**: Community Water Level specific features:
   - Real-time water level dashboard
   - IoT device management interface
   - Interactive map visualization
   - Alert and notification system
   - Data analytics and reporting
